## Data Exploration on Marijuana Arrests(D.C) &amp; NYPD 
According to the ACLU’s original analysis, marijuana arrests now account for over half of all drug arrests in the United States. Of the 8.2 million␣marijuana arrests between 2001 and 2010,88% were for simply having marijuana. Nationwide, the arrest data revealed one consistent trend: significant racial bias. Despite roughly equal usage rates, Blacks are 3.73 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana. The laws related to the recreational use and possession of marijuana have changed at two milestones: the effective dates of the Marijuana Possession Decriminalization Amendment Act of 2014 on July 17, 2014, and of Initiative 71 on February 26, 2015 [URL](https://mpdc.dc.gov/marijuana.)
